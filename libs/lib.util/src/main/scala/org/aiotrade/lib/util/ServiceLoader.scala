/**
 * A simple service-provider loading facility.
 *
 * <p> A <i>service</i> is a well-known set of interfaces and (usually
 * abstract) classes.  A <i>service provider</i> is a specific implementation
 * of a service.  The classes in a provider typically implement the interfaces
 * and subclass the classes defined in the service itself.  Service providers
 * can be installed in an implementation of the Java platform in the form of
 * extensions, that is, jar files placed into any of the usual extension
 * directories.  Providers can also be made available by adding them to the
 * application's class path or by some other platform-specific means.
 *
 * <p> For the purpose of loading, a service is represented by a single type,
 * that is, a single interface or abstract class.  (A concrete class can be
 * used, but this is not recommended.)  A provider of a given service contains
 * one or more concrete classes that extend this <i>service type</i> with data
 * and code specific to the provider.  The <i>provider class</i> is typically
 * not the entire provider itself but rather a proxy which contains enough
 * information to decide whether the provider is able to satisfy a particular
 * request together with code that can create the actual provider on demand.
 * The details of provider classes tend to be highly service-specific; no
 * single class or interface could possibly unify them, so no such type is
 * defined here.  The only requirement enforced by this facility is that
 * provider classes must have a zero-argument constructor so that they can be
 * instantiated during loading.
 *
 * <p><a name="format"> A service provider is identified by placing a
 * <i>provider-configuration file</i> in the resource directory
 * <tt>META-INF/services</tt>.  The file's name is the fully-qualified <a
 * href="../lang/ClassLoader.html#name">binary name</a> of the service's type.
 * The file contains a list of fully-qualified binary names of concrete
 * provider classes, one per line.  Space and tab characters surrounding each
 * name, as well as blank lines, are ignored.  The comment character is
 * <tt>'#'</tt> (<tt>'&#92;u0023'</tt>, <font size="-1">NUMBER SIGN</font>); on
 * each line all characters following the first comment character are ignored.
 * The file must be encoded in UTF-8.
 *
 * <p> If a particular concrete provider class is named in more than one
 * configuration file, or is named in the same configuration file more than
 * once, then the duplicates are ignored.  The configuration file naming a
 * particular provider need not be in the same jar file or other distribution
 * unit as the provider itself.  The provider must be accessible from the same
 * class loader that was initially queried to locate the configuration file;
 * note that this is not necessarily the class loader from which the file was
 * actually loaded.
 *
 * <p> Providers are located and instantiated lazily, that is, on demand.  A
 * service loader maintains a cache of the providers that have been loaded so
 * far.  Each invocation of the {@link #iterator iterator} method returns an
 * iterator that first yields all of the elements of the cache, in
 * instantiation order, and then lazily locates and instantiates any remaining
 * providers, adding each one to the cache in turn.  The cache can be cleared
 * via the {@link #reload reload} method.
 *
 * <p> Service loaders always execute in the security context of the caller.
 * Trusted system code should typically invoke the methods in this class, and
 * the methods of the iterators which they return, from within a privileged
 * security context.
 *
 * <p> Instances of this class are not safe for use by multiple concurrent
 * threads.
 *
 * <p> Unless otherwise specified, passing a <tt>null</tt> argument to any
 * method in this class will cause a {@link NullPointerException} to be thrown.
 *
 *
 * <p><span style="font-weight: bold; padding-right: 1em">Example</span>
 * Suppose we have a service type <tt>com.example.CodecSet</tt> which is
 * intended to represent sets of encoder/decoder pairs for some protocol.  In
 * this case it is an abstract class with two abstract methods:
 *
 * <blockquote><pre>
 * public abstract Encoder getEncoder(String encodingName);
 * public abstract Decoder getDecoder(String encodingName);</pre></blockquote>
 *
 * Each method returns an appropriate object or <tt>null</tt> if the provider
 * does not support the given encoding.  Typical providers support more than
 * one encoding.
 *
 * <p> If <tt>com.example.impl.StandardCodecs</tt> is an implementation of the
 * <tt>CodecSet</tt> service then its jar file also contains a file named
 *
 * <blockquote><pre>
 * META-INF/services/com.example.CodecSet</pre></blockquote>
 *
 * <p> This file contains the single line:
 *
 * <blockquote><pre>
 * com.example.impl.StandardCodecs    # Standard codecs</pre></blockquote>
 *
 * <p> The <tt>CodecSet</tt> class creates and saves a single service instance
 * at initialization:
 *
 * <blockquote><pre>
 * private static ServiceLoader&lt;CodecSet&gt; codecSetLoader
 *     = ServiceLoader.load(CodecSet.class);</pre></blockquote>
 *
 * <p> To locate an encoder for a given encoding name it defines a static
 * factory method which iterates through the known and available providers,
 * returning only when it has located a suitable encoder or has run out of
 * providers.
 *
 * <blockquote><pre>
 * public static Encoder getEncoder(String encodingName) {
 *     for (CodecSet cp : codecSetLoader) {
 *         Encoder enc = cp.getEncoder(encodingName);
 *         if (enc != null)
 *             return enc;
 *     }
 *     return null;
 * }</pre></blockquote>
 *
 * <p> A <tt>getDecoder</tt> method is defined similarly.
 *
 *
 * <p><span style="font-weight: bold; padding-right: 1em">Usage Note</span> If
 * the class path of a class loader that is used for provider loading includes
 * remote network URLs then those URLs will be dereferenced in the process of
 * searching for provider-configuration files.
 *
 * <p> This activity is normal, although it may cause puzzling entries to be
 * created in web-server logs.  If a web server is not configured correctly,
 * however, then this activity may cause the provider-loading algorithm to fail
 * spuriously.
 *
 * <p> A web server should return an HTTP 404 (Not Found) response when a
 * requested resource does not exist.  Sometimes, however, web servers are
 * erroneously configured to return an HTTP 200 (OK) response along with a
 * helpful HTML error page in such cases.  This will cause a {@link
 * ServiceConfigurationError} to be thrown when this class attempts to parse
 * the HTML page as a provider-configuration file.  The best solution to this
 * problem is to fix the misconfigured web server to return the correct
 * response code (HTTP 404) along with the HTML error page.
